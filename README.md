# Hey thereðŸ‘‹
 
 ### I'm Lipika, a full-time Data Engineer at Xiaomi's GTM-Business in the Strategy Planning team. With over 2 years of experience at Xiaomi, my journey started as a Data Engineer Intern in the IT Department, and I've been riding the data wave ever since. I wield SQL, Python, and Pyspark like a data-slinging superhero, turning messy data into actionable insights.

### I collaborate closely with business teams, giving me a solid understanding of the business landscape and how data can drive strategic decisions. Problem-solving? That's my jam! Whether it's untangling a gnarly data knot, optimizing pipelines, or building Power BI visualizations that make data come alive, I dive in with gusto. When I'm not wrangling data, you might find me dreaming up new ways to leverage data for strategic awesomeness.

### Join me on my GitHub adventure, where code meets creativity and data dreams come true!
